    "description": "Inquisitors are magical bodyguards and interrogators skilled in uncovering plots and opposing enemy magic. Inquisitorial magic is subtle in its effects, with few sensory cues, but very distinctive with regard to its caster. Inquisitors learn to use their force of will to intimidate foes, and so they typically growl their spells loudly and gesture clearly at their spell\u2019s targets. They use few directly offensive spells, though many can create flaming barriers for defense or to trap foes. Inquisitors are easily recognized for their masks, which they claim protect their souls from enemy magic. Most Inquisitor masks are wood or stone carved in the shape of bearskulls, and many Inquisitors favor bearskin cloaks. They seldom arm themselves with more than a claw-shaped dagger. Inquisitors learn their spells from copies of old spellbooks, scribed by the founders of the Inquisitorial order centuries ago. These spellbooks are written in a civilized form of Orcish, and are closely protected by the order that owns them. Experienced Inquisitors also usually study the magic of other groups to be better able to counterspell it.",
