    "description": "The cleric devotes his or her life to a higher power, hoping to serve that power\u2019s will. Whether the cleric serves a noble god or a vicious demon lord, he or she gains power from faith, and learns to wield powerful magic in the service of his or her deity. Clerics are also trained to be capable warriors, able to defend themselves physically if their spells fail them. Since clerics deal more in abstract realms of the soul and the spirit, their magic has a definite slant toward the intangible, generally eschewing direct offensive magic in favor of spells that affect creatures\u2019 essence and behavior, or that make creatures more or less able to battle. Most clerics worship one specific deity from a pantheon, but still respect other members of that pantheon, even if they are not actual followers. The agendas of deities\u2019 worshippers may conflict in the realm of mortals, but it is folly to defy even enemy deities. Thus, though a cleric may choose to change the deity he or she reveres, if the clerics truly abandons the pantheon, he or she will never be accepted by any deity, being forced to rely on mortal magic alone.",
